collection: publications
permalink: /publication/CS object detection
excerpt: ' Object detection and localization can be possible directly in the Compressed Domain (easily upto 20x compression).
Achieved SOTA 46.27% mAP(Mean Average Precision) on a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with an inference time of 23ms.
Deployed on a NVIDIA TX2 embedded board with 45.11% mAP with an inference time of 34ms.'
