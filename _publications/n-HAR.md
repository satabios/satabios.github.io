excerpt: ' A Neuromorphic Event-Based Human Activity Recognition System using Memory Surfaces. We used event memory surfaces to make the sparse event data compatible with deep  convolutional  neural  networks  (CNNs).  We  leverage  upon the recent advances in deep convolutional networks based video analysis  and  adapt  such  frameworks  onto  the  neuromorphicdomain.  We  also  provide  the  community  with  a  new  dataset consisting of five categories of human activities captured in realworld  without  any  simulations.  We  achieved  an  accuracy  of 94.3%  using  event  memory  surfaces  on  our  activity  recognition dataset.'
